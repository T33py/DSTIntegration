Welcome to the DSTIntegration library and CLI.

This has been developed as a holliday fun project, and as such documentation may be lacking.

The CLI is currently under construction and as such the Library is having its quality of life functionality implemented as is needed for that.
Features currently implemented:
 - To end interaction type "exit" or "-e"
 - Retrieve the table subjects by using "-subjects" or "-subs"
	- 

Missing functionality of note:
 - parsing strings in the commandline (arguments surrounded by "")
 - table metadata
 - building limited scope metadata for use with getting table data
 - table data
 - keeping track of data retrieved, so it can be written to files
 - writing data to files
